## Sections
This project will focus in three cornerstone aspects of blockchain technology. <br>
Using Bitcoin as an example, the authors will discuss Merkle Trees, Consensus, and Encryption.

### Merkle Trees
A Merkle tree is a data structure used in blockchain technology. <br>
The tree is constructed by recursively hashing pairs of leafs until reaching the top. <br>
The final hash is called the Merkle Root, and is a representation of all transactions included in a Bitcoin block. <br>
This project will include source code for obtaining data from www.blockchain.info using GET requests in python and recreating the Merkle Roof by recursively hashing the transactions in a block.

### Encryption
Encryption is the process of encoding a message or information that only authorized parties can access, not allowing unauthorized personal to access. Bitcoin utilizes an encpryption based on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm(ECDSA), along with the elliptic curve secp256k1. bitcoin also utilizes The Secure Hash Algorithm(SHA) to hash transactions securely. There are a few variation of SHA consisting of SHA256 and SHA1 used in bitcoin. This project with analyze and compare different encryption methods that are used in bitcoins with other encpryption methods outside of bitcoin.
